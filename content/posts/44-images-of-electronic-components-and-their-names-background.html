    <h3>How to troubleshoot electronics down to the component level without schematics.</h3>
    <p>When learning mobile repairing, it is important to learn and understand how to identity these small parts or electronic components and understand their function. Learn about electronic components in our online tutorials: When building electronic circuits, you will work with a number of basic electronic components, including like the name suggests, the device resists the flow of current. There are standard symbols for each of the components which represent that particular component.</p>
